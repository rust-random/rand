//! A distribution uniformly sampling numbers within a given range.
//!
//! [`Uniform`] is the standard distribution to sample uniformly from a range;
//! e.g. `Uniform::new_inclusive(1, 6)` can sample integers from 1 to 6, like a
//! standard die. [`Rng::gen_range`] supports any type supported by
//! [`Uniform`].
//!
//! This distribution is provided with support for several primitive types
//! (all integer and floating-point types) as well as [`std::time::Duration`],
//! and supports extension to user-defined types via a type-specific *back-end*
//! implementation.
//!
//! The types [`UniformInt`], [`UniformFloat`] and [`UniformDuration`] are the
//! back-ends supporting sampling from primitive integer and floating-point
//! ranges as well as from [`std::time::Duration`]; these types do not normally
//! need to be used directly (unless implementing a derived back-end).
//!
//! # Example usage
//!
//! ```
//! use rand::{Rng, thread_rng};
//! use rand::distributions::Uniform;
//!
//! let mut rng = thread_rng();
//! let side = Uniform::new(-10.0, 10.0);
//!
//! // sample between 1 and 10 points
//! for _ in 0..rng.gen_range(1..=10) {
//!     // sample a point from the square with sides -10 - 10 in two dimensions
//!     let (x, y) = (rng.sample(side), rng.sample(side));
//!     println!("Point: {}, {}", x, y);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Extending `Uniform` to support a custom type
//!
//! To extend [`Uniform`] to support your own types, write a back-end which
//! implements the [`UniformSampler`] trait, then implement the [`SampleUniform`]
//! helper trait to "register" your back-end. See the `MyF32` example below.
//!
//! At a minimum, the back-end needs to store any parameters needed for sampling
//! (e.g. the target range) and implement `new`, `new_inclusive` and `sample`.
//! Those methods should include an assert to check the range is valid (i.e.
//! `low < high`). The example below merely wraps another back-end.
//!
//! The `new`, `new_inclusive` and `sample_single` functions use arguments of
//! type SampleBorrow<X> in order to support passing in values by reference or
//! by value. In the implementation of these functions, you can choose to
//! simply use the reference returned by [`SampleBorrow::borrow`], or you can choose
//! to copy or clone the value, whatever is appropriate for your type.
//!
//! ```
//! use rand::prelude::*;

//!     type X = MyF32;

/// [`Uniform::new`] and [`Uniform::new_inclusive`] construct a uniform
/// distribution sampling from the given range; these functions may do extra
/// work up front to make sampling of multiple values faster. If only one sample
/// from the range is required, [`Rng::gen_range`] can be more efficient.
///
/// When sampling from a constant range, many calculations can happen at
/// compile-time and all methods should be fast; for floating-point ranges and
/// the full range of integer types this should have comparable performance to
/// the `Standard` distribution.
///
/// Steps are taken to avoid bias which might be present in naive
/// implementations; for example `rng.gen::<u8>() % 170` samples from the range
/// `[0, 169]` but is twice as likely to select numbers less than 85 than other
/// values. Further, the implementations here give more weight to the high-bits
/// generated by the RNG than the low bits, since with some RNGs the low-bits
/// are of lower quality than the high bits.
///
/// Implementations must sample in `[low, high)` range for
/// `Uniform::new(low, high)`, i.e., excluding `high`. In particular, care must
/// be taken to ensure that rounding never results values `< low` or `>= high`.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use rand::distributions::{Distribution, Uniform};

/// let between = Uniform::from(10..10000);

/// let mut sum = 0;
/// for _ in 0..1000 {
///     sum += between.sample(&mut rng);
