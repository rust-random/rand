Implements a selection of PCG random number generators.

> PCG is a family of simple fast space-efficient statistically good algorithms
> for random number generation. [Melissa O'Neill, Harvey Mudd College, 2014].

The PCG algorithms are not suitable for cryptographic uses, but perform well
in statistical tests, use little memory and are fairly fast.
See the [pcg-random website](http://www.pcg-random.org/).

This crate depends on [rand_core](https://crates.io/crates/rand_core) and is
part of the [Rand project](https://github.com/rust-random/rand).
